Documentation not complete...

Basic information:
-Files used by the engine are inside their own folder, which usually are \script\ for the script, \CG\ for the images, \movie\ for animations, and \wave\ for audio.
-Files are usually inside .pak containers, but the engine supports loading of unpacked files.
-Engine usually doesn't allow the game to be run if it's not installed. Unknown if this behavior can be modified.

Engine filetypes:

---.pak: Package resourse. Container of engine files.
#Open with Garbro.

---.idx: Package resourse key file. Used by the engine and tools to open .pak files.
#No need to touch this.
